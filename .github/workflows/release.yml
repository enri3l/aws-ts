# Release Workflow
#
# Automated release pipeline using Release-Please for PR-based releases.
# Creates Release PRs with version bumps and changelogs, then publishes
# when Release PR is merged.
#
# Triggered on: Push to main branch (after PR merge)
# Security: OIDC token for npm provenance, comprehensive dependency review
# Output: Release PR creation or NPM package + GitHub release
